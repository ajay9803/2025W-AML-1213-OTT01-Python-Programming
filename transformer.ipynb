    "What Are Transformers?\n",
    "==========================\n",
    "Transformers are a type of deep learning model used for **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and other AI tasks.  \n",
    "They use a mechanism called **self-attention** to process entire sentences **in parallel**, making them faster and more efficient than older models like RNNs and LSTMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "How Do Transformers Work?\n",
    "=============================\n",
    "**Tokenization:** The input text is converted into numerical tokens.  \n",
    "**Embeddings:** These tokens are transformed into dense vector representations.  \n",
    "**Self-Attention:** The model determines which words are most important in the sentence.  \n",
    "**Positional Encoding:** Since transformers process words simultaneously, they need positional encoding to understand word order.  \n",
    "**Feed-Forward Layers:** The model passes data through multiple layers to refine understanding.  \n",
    "**Output Layer:** The final output is used for NLP tasks like classification, translation, or text generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Are Transformers Powerful?\n",
    "==================================\n",
    "They process entire sentences at once (parallel processing).  \n",
    "They can understand long-range dependencies in text.  \n",
    "They power state-of-the-art models like **BERT, GPT, T5, and RoBERTa**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Transformers have **revolutionized NLP** and are widely used in chatbots, search engines, and machine translation. \n",
